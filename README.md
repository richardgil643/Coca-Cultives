# Coca-Cultives

This project aims to predict coca cultives with satelital imagery and neural networks. 
get_data: defines a training geodataframe with coca cultives spots and non coca cultives points in Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. 
image_scrapping:  webscraps the satelital images of the coca and non coca cultives define on get_data.
Neural_Networks:  defines a recurent neural network and CNN to predict coca cultives.
